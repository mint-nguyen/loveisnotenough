      Today is a tough day for me, Oct 08 21, The day I lost you. I can't focus on anything and my mind is always thinking about you. I told myself that I need to be stronger, I need to be the person you and I, we both want me to become: be mature and get a nice job. I was sad and disappointed when you didn't phone me when landing as you promise. But then I realized, it was too hard for you to hear my voice and see my face. It won't be easy but we can do it. I learned from you that I came to Reddit and looked for some advice. I saw this and I thought you might need it too! Ah, I forgot to clean the dish and Rowena yelled at me`,

    Today I talked with cô Hiếu in bakery and seeked advice from her. She is almost 45. She told me that I was young and free, do whatever I want and constantly boost myself up to make those who dont deserve me have to look up to me. She hugged me, I felt less painful thanks to her. And then Chú Phát the manager, saw me so sad and then we three had a deep conversation about life about the toughness everyone has to go through. I felt much more positive when I had them care about me and tried to boost me up. It is the first time I opened up myself and talked about my tough life with someone else other than you, which I found awesome. It turned out that there are many people out there caring about me more than I thought. Look for someone you found on Free4talk and freely ask them then you may receive great help. But I think you should talk to those who are in their 30+ or 50+ as co Hieu and chu Phat. 
    
    And Marvin and Rowena were really upset because we said we would extend till February and now we stopped it. They will post the room on Marketplace on Facebook and will see.
    
    I'm starting the website right when I finish the figma and UI tool kit. Waittt.

    Hi baby,
    
    How's your first night sleeping without me? Bet it was not easy for both of us. When coming back from work, I took a shower, got into my desk and did my cover letter, watched coding videos and did some figma. When seeing you online, I was happy that at least you can control yourself not to break down and think too much about me. It was warm to hear your voice. I slept at 11PM after doing skincare and couldn't sleep more until 4AM. So I decided to write you something. I opened up my Note and saw something. It was when You and I were not seeing each other in real life (when I was in Vietnam). When you were coaching me, I couldn't focus on studying and then we started storytelling with each other. I listed a lot of foods I want to eat with you when we would come back to VN together. And look, this is the note I took when you told me about your childhood. I named it Henry folder, and some are the tips I learnt from Tôm on Free4talk to be a better girlfriend. The only thing that I couldn't do right now is that I can't eat anything. For the whole day, I just drank water... Don't worry, I will eat to live, to make things work between us again!

    Em muốn hỏi anh một câu: Anh có nghĩ rằng chúng mình sẽ quay lại với nhau được không? Hay anh chỉ không muốn nói lời cự tuyệt với em? Hôm nay em nói chuyện với Willy, ổng là người lớn tuổi và trải sự đời. Willy khuyên em nên suy nghĩ cho bản thân, xây dựng self respect và hãy single cho đến khi mày nghĩ mày đủ trách nhiệm khi ở trong một mối quan hệ. Em nhận ra nhiều điều. Rằng em phản bội anh, là em đã coi thường anh, em đã tổn thương lòng tự trọng của anh. Và em tự làm hại chính mình, sẽ không ai muốn yêu một cheater. Anh đã nói rằng em là cheater với cả nhà anh, và em nghĩ lòng tự trọng của anh không cho phép anh yêu em thêm một lần nữa (Không muốn ngu thêm lần nữa) Rằng nếu như em có thực sự trưởng thành, thực sự gánh vác được trách nhiệm của mình, là người mà anh và em muốn em hướng tới, mình có quay lại yêu thêm lần nữa, em nghĩ anh sẽ không chịu được việc bị mọi người judge anh vì em biết, anh đề cao self respect hơn ai hết. Willy nói với em rằng, đó là bản chất của human beings. Một khi mày đã cheat người ta, dù có hàn gắn lại, 15,20, hay 25 năm sau, khi mày cãi vã, người ta sẽ mang chuyện này ra để sỉ nhục mày. Hoặc nếu không sỉ nhục mày, người ta sẽ để trong lòng tự trách mình đã quá ngu. Nói tóm lại, mày phải hiểu, mày là cheater, mày không đáng để người ta respect! Em rất đau lòng! All I feel is remorse right now. Em chỉ cần anh trả lời em thôi: Nếu anh nhận ra sự thay đổi trong em, biết rằng em đã thực sự trưởng thành và self esteem và responsible với việc mình làm, anh có thể cho em sự tin tưởng một lần nữa hay không? Hay anh sẽ vì self respect của mình mà sợ người ta bàn tán mà dù có yêu em sâu đậm thế nào đi nữa cũng sẽ rời bỏ em dứt khoát? Nếu anh thực sự nghĩ như thế, em sẽ dứt khoát kết thúc việc theo đuổi anh lại và em không muốn ép buộc làm khó anh. 
    Em hy vọng sẽ nhận lại được hồi âm của anh.
    Yêu và hôn và thương thương anh,
    Mint của anh.`,

    Today I feel so positive. I reached out to a senior IT student who is the president of IT club in my school, remember her? I asked her about her journey to teach herself Javascript and Apple internship opportunities. She said she followed tech twitter and one day she saw an Apple engineer finding SWE for his team. She reached him out and fortunately she got response from him. He forwarded her resume to other team and she got internship position!!! I think I should be more active on LinkedIn, Indeed, and Twitter!!!! Arhhh, I go hiking today with the white guy. He is a hiking lover and invites me out to discuss more about his app. Well it's good because I want to know how he teaches himself back-end development and how he connects with others. Also, it's ThanksGiving and no one invites me out except him. So okay, I don't want to be in 4-wall room and get stressed out missing you. Will get back to you soon when I learn something from him jkjkjk! 
    Arh, I did piano of Hunting. It's terrible :( But I want you to keep up with me ;)
    P/s: I realize that morning is the perfect time to practice piano, fresh mind! 
    P/s2: I feel relieved and slept well last night after hearing back from you, darling.

    Marvin told me that anyway I wouldn't receive my deposit back. Because he saw there is a long crack which was caused by the bed when you moved it. And because I gave him such short notice. I still look for a room right now but I believe I can find one. So I told him that I will move out on 28th Oct and he will get other tenants to live in the room. Haizz!!! He said he called you so many times but you didn't respond.
    Plus, I went to Lynn Valley to go hiking today with Mike. He is from Ukraine. I learnt a lot from him today. He told me about his projects and how he taught himself coding. He is now in a team, they want to build a decision-making app, mostly about machine learning and AI. Pretty cool!!! I feel very fresh after a while not going out. But he talked A LOT, like A LOT for the whole time even when I got tired and cannot talk anymore. OMG! 
    I have a meeting with chị Thu Anh(The Apple intern one) on Wednesday to open my connection and let's see what I can learn from her. She is a disabled but works very hard to become her now. And she got a lot of luck.

    content: `To my baby,

    We parted with each other, no one wants such a thing. We got along with each other and we did genuinely wanted to tie the knot. We both got hurt deeply in our hearts. I know it is hard to leave. But deep in my heart, I know that I am not ready for such generous love from you. 
    
    First, I do not think I understand what responsibilities it takes to make a commitment with you. Yes, I want to take care of you, I want to be the one who makes you breakfast every day, the one who eats and shares food with you, the one who does skincare for you and exercises with you. I realize, what I want is all about physically being together. My mind doesn’t seem like getting ready to be with you. I know that because I still hadn’t set clear boundaries and that I did have feelings for someone so easily. You are right, love is not enough! 
    
    Second, I haven’t been financially independent. I hate it when you were always the one who contributes financially to this relationship. I hate it when you feel discomfort when having to spend a lot on eating out, hanging out, and furniture. Basically, I didn’t contribute anything. That discomforts you, and I get irritated when I couldn’t do anything, too. Sometimes, I can feel how it annoys you by the way you care about your finance, and I feel helpless. Sometimes, I think is it true that I hadn’t fallen for you because of being so financially comfortable but because I truly love you or not.
    
    Losing you is a lesson and a challenge at the same time. I realize that yes, I genuinely love you because I feel hurt, really hurt. When I saw you crying that much for the first time, my heart and my body fell apart. My loving man had never expressed a moment of weakness, now he was crying. But I couldn’t do anything to get my man up, even a small thing as hugging him. I told to myself, look what you have done, you little bastard, idiot, jerk. It has been a fact not a mistake to be fixed. What we can do now is to get ourselves together, evolve together, become a better version of ourselves, so that we can fall in love together without letting the past hurt us.
    
    For me, I set my goals clearly. I stopped my bad habits of overusing social media, being ridiculously a baby, being untidy, and being dishonest. I set my boundaries, CLEARLY. I become actively involved in my surroundings, studious, curious about tech, human beings, creativity, and nature. I will spend this break time of us experiencing more and more, to stay connected with good people, to stay alert about traps, and to think carefully about what lessons I have learned from the past to find a solution and to stay away from problems.
    
    For you, you got your family, you got Brian, be Truc. They are the ones who never leave you. Talk to them more, hang out with them. Do a lot of exercise! And save up your money to start your dream. Don’t be so stressed out my baby. You always got me back you up. Journaling for me is a good idea. You can express yourself, it helps you get away from being so lonely! Don’t be too strict with yourself. Miss me unbearably? Call me! It’s okay my baby! Tell me what you feel, I want to know. 
    
    I will make a new you fall in love with a new me.
    
    Love you always,

    How have you been? Is everything okay on your end? Please remember that I always got your back! The weather is really harsh on me. Raining and freezing! I don't want to go out without you, I want you back. I miss you so much. I just cannot hold it anymore. I really miss you. I have been crying a lot since you moved out, every single day, every morning and night. Did you read the message on Messenger from me and chi Van Dang? She is in her second year, majoring in Business Administration. She used to work in 88 supermarket, the one who helped me transfer money to má mì. She told me she saw us a couple of times, she asked why I had to find another room. I said because you moved out, I want to get bigger on my own, I don't want your love to spoil me. And then after graduation, we will move to next step. 
    I really hate this city. We have been together to so many places. Every where I go, I always think of you. It is annoying me! And all of a sudden, I burst into tears. 
    And I told Rowena and Marvin that what if they make a little room in the living room, just like a half of the living room, I don't need it to be so big. And because downstairs we have a shared bathroom. So that I don't need to move out. Everything is still good for me, it's good for all of us. They can have extra money each month. I can still live here without moving out. What an idea! But they didn't reply to me :( 
    Okay, I will tell you when we get a decision! Call me whenever you want, your call yesterday made my day.

    Are you OK now? How's your headache? Probably because you miss me so much and don't take care of yourself. I wish I were there looking after you. You are in my thoughts, my dreams, and my every day and night. 
    I packed some of the things, we have a lot of kitchen stuff. I still hold a hope that we can be together again, so I just cannot let it go. Anyway, I think it's good too, because I can use them to learn to cook new dishes. It might take a while, I have so many things to pack, OMG. And I asked Rowena if she can help me transport stuff to a new place, she refuses right away. Pretty sad, huh? I will call an UberX, probably two UberX, I guess... I haven't packed the piano yet, and the chair I donot know how to take it apart to get it into the car. OMG, so many stuff, wish I had someone to help me. 
    I talked to Jay and learned something new about me. He said the are two different characters inside me because I'm Gemini. I make a decision based on my emotions and get unexcited easily. But it's not true when it comes to my determination. You know I have been through odds to come to here studying abroad. I made impossible into possible in almost 2 years of high school. When I set my goals, I stick to it to the end and put much of dedication and determination. My goal now is to win your heart by demonstrating how I evolve. My love for you is so huge that it keeps me motivated day by day. It is a hard time, very hard time for me. But you know, how hard it is, I can get through it, right? And toughness makes me bigger, my love.

They want me to move out on 15 to spend the room for the other couple. He has been trying to find faults with me to take my deposit. I know we haven't signed the lease yet, and we are totally fine if we moved out at the end of this month. I don't want to make things complicated and make sure everyone is happy with that. So I move out even though I am entitled to the room and just want the half-month rent back. I think the more I tolerate, the more he pushes me!

    I read 6 habits appear to be toxic but healthy in a relationship.
    1. Let some conflicts be unsolved. Most unsuccessful couples insist that they need to solve every conflict they have. Sometimes, trying to solve conflicts just creates more problems. I cannot think of any problem we had or any conflict.
    2. Be willing to hurt each other's feelings. You try to be patient and keep all worries to yourself. But it just hurts yourself so much that sometimes you feel suffocating of being so kind to others. Being with me means being yourself. I don't want you to keep it all to yourself and try to be patient and kind. I want you to be in the most comfy mood being with me.
    3. Be willing to end. If you know that relationship is toxic, end it. It may hurt but it's worth. You won't suffer more from it. That's why I don't want to force you to stay, everyone gets hurt. 
    4. Accept each other's flaws. No one is perfect. We are two imperfections finding the other half to make us perfect and powerful again. Learn to accept each other's flaws and get together to be a perfect fit.
    5. Spend time apart. Being together doesn't mean spending all the time together. We both have our own space to enjoy ourselves. I used to think that being with you was worth the time not socializing myself. I felt happy being with you and that being with others was not worth. I used to like getting more friends, being positive, doing and learning new stuff that make me intellectual stimulating. I realized that I felt so comfy being with you that I forgot the one who you were in love at the first place: emotionally independent, sociable, and determined. Let's give each other more time and space of our own.
    6. Feel the attractions from people outside the relationship. It's normal that you find others attractive but choosing not to let it go beyond the limit is an action. It should act as a reminder that you did fall in love with your partner because they have all of that attractions and even more that make you become couple. 
    Let me hear your thoughts.

    How was your sleep last night? Did you sleep well? I was very happy and felt released after our talk yesterday. Was it the first time after our breakup you being honest with me? I wanna know if there is something you cannot tell me because you are afraid to hurt me. I won't ask, make sure you feel comfy when you tell me. Well, after a fall-off, present Mint is becoming stronger and stronger than ever before. Nothing can hurt me anymore, except one thing: you do not take care of yourself. So make sure that you are OK and together, I will be here, getting you out of the shits. 
    I read 5 reasons why people do not respect your boundaries and found out that OMG, they match myself like 90%.
    1. I was too vague about setting my boundaries. At the first place, I did verbalise it but I felt like it was not clear enough
    2. I was embarrassed when setting my boundaries. I used to be dceived that the boundaries I set parted me away from the rest of the world. I was held captive because I worship the boundaries when being a relationship. But it was not true, I could have friends of my own, the point was I needed to balance the time on my own world and our world too.
    3. Probably, I was too flexible when it came to having opposite-gendered friends. I didn't set a clear boundaries for myself.
    4. Yes, some people just ignore my boundaries and do crazy things. They have no respect for other and they have no self-respect either.
    5. Verbalizing my boundaries once is not enough. To make it clear and straight, I should have done it twice, three, or even get to do the toughest action to cut them all.
    What do you think about this? Did I fully understand the boundaries?

    content: `Baby, I am happy that we get to know each other more and deeper. I feel released after telling you the secret I buried for long. And I can feel the release from you after you told me your traumatic experience. Good work!
    I read 3 reasons why women have rape fantasies. 
    1. Blame avoidance: "It was not my fault" No, it was my fault, I knew that because of my weakness and vague boundaries that let him have a chance to do that. I feel remorse and depressed and whenever coming home, seeing your loving face made me cry. Sometimes I cannot hold it, I burst into tears.
    2. Sexual openness: "I have the freedom to fantasize anything." No, it was not me either. I'm not the kind who let everyone fuck me. 
    3. Sexual desirability: "I'm hot. I drive men crazy" It sounds like me. He makes me feel like I'm the hottest woman in this world by his behaviours. His forceful actions show his strong desire. But sadly, I couldn't see your eagerness in having sex with me and your desire for my body, I couldn't feel that I'm hot... I know it might be hurt for you, but I want to be honest to let you know how I felt. When I was out of that sexual desirability, I felt disgusting about myself and the one who I cheated with. I didn't want to stay with him after that. It didn't feel peaceful and satisfied as the way I slept in your hands. 
    Probably, it was because we watched porn a lot, like A LOT that we lost interest and eagerness in making love. He told me that he even doesn't masturbate because he doesn't want that faking scenarios affect his feeling for his partner. He just watched porn once in a blue moon when he couldn't use mind controlling. 
    I think he is right. Alright, I will call you after work, I really want to know how you think and how we can fix this.

    I wasn't going to send you an email today. I almost forgot, to be honest. 
    After out talk last night, I couldn't sleep. There were so much to think about and my mind was about to be blown off. I kept thinking about your forgiveness, my remorseful feelings, and the incredible fact that I just found out.
    Your forgiveness made me even feel much more guilty over cheating. You were so kind to forgive such a cheater as me. I kept thinking over and over and started looking for advice on Reddit. I know that I shouldn't keep this guilt and should move forward to deserve your forgiveness. I know that you should deserve much better  and that I should give it all to you. I should be a better girlfriend (a better wife in the future) and give all of best what I can do to you. But the guilt is so huge and your kindness is so generous that It feels so heavy on my heart, my shoulder, and my mind. I can't help blaming myself. But don't worry baby, I can keep on the right track by myself. I read more and understand more and get mentally bigger. Time goes by, I will find way healing my soul and yours too. I will be patient, slow and control. I want to make sure that my dump emotions won't get in the way. I'm sorry I cannot promise you anything right now, I cannot hurt you anymore. I want to use my actions to show you first, after completing a promise, I will promise you that...
    The fact that all the men I get in touch with can have a probability of having sexual desire for my body makes me out of my mind. It was like a slap on my little innocent, stupid, dump, childish mindset. I realized I can no longer be as open, worry-free, and easy as I used to be in high school. That hurts me. That means I can no longer have fun being worry-free. I understood why I felt like I was trapped in that hurtful relationship. I didn't ever think about setting boundaries with opposite-gendered friends. I used to treat them just fairly as with my female friends. It became a green light hint to them that makes them take action and get to do the wrongs. Realization is good, at least I have come to realize the problem. Find a solution to it might take time to practice. But you know baby, I'm trying to be patient, right? 
    Don't worry, your little girl is getting bigger. She starts to know what is right and what is wrong, and that she is not so dump anymore to ever do the things that she knows it is wrong. She is being punished. But she can stand up and be stronger than ever before, baby. Don't make a move, just watch how she makes you move.

    How do you feel today? How was your sleep last night? I feel terrible today. I had a bad dream and I kept crying in my dream. I was very scared, directionless, and trying to hold on something that was too vague. I woke up early and could't sleep again. Seems like the integrity is punishing me, LOL.
    I realized both of my sexual traumatic chilhood when I got raped were related to my being unaware of setting boundaries. The first time I was in a nice dress with my peers (about 5-6 years of age). We wanted to take the fruits up high in the trees. That rapist said if I came with him to his house, he would take the fruits for us. I had no idea what would happen to me next and I AGREED to go with him blindly. What happened happened. The next time was me who voluntarily AGREED to get night date with him. Again, the mistake was taken again and I didn't know how to protect myself. If it weren't you who are so kind and loving, I would keep making that mistake of not setting boundaries again and again. And I doubted myself if that were the case, when I would realize this shit and what kinda person I would turn into. Even though I got to be aware of the root of it, I even doubted myself if I would ever do it again... Ngựa quen đường cũ. I'm afraid that I could not hold myself. 
    Don't worry! I learn to set boundaries and be very alert of hanging out with men. I try to read more and learn more. Today I will start reading about keeping my hands to myself! Fighting baby, we can do it together. New us, new relationship. Take it slow and under control baby, you don't need to force yourself to do the things you don't want to do. I am trying every single day to make new Henry fall in love with new Mint. It is hard for you to say I love you because you haven't been ready to enter the relationship. It's still too early to let both of us recover. But baby, take your time!

    Today is the first day since you left that I go out for a walk. I think to myself that I need to get out of the tiny room, get some fresh air, and refresh my mind. But no, everything is too cruel to me. What I feel is loneliness and pain. Every where I go, I can always relate to the good old days when we were walking on that street together. It is hurtful and I again can't hold my tears back. The trees are out of leaves, they look lonely, bare, and sad. I miss your big, warm, safe hands, I miss hugging you in the cold weather, wating for the bus, I miss you so much. 
    On the way home, I came across chú Lập (the one living in Coquitlam that helps me find a job when I was in quarantine) in Tim Hortons. He was with his friend drinking coffee. He is now working in Lucky also. 
    Today I learn about building trust in a relationship. There are two processes: trusting yourself and building trust in your partner.
    1. In trusting yourself, first, you got to be transparent about what you do and do what you say. Second, show skills, showing how you deserve to be with your partner, what you can provide and contribute to the relationship. Last, deliver results. Combine three together, you gain trust in yourself. I don't trust myself. I talk a lot, promise a lot but I barely get anything done. I'm afraid to make unfixable mistakes again. Right now I lose faith in myself, and that's what I'm trying to gain.
    2. Building trust in your partner. 
    - Say what you mean, be direct. Luckily, you got me do this from the beginning. I used to take many assumptions that if you cared about me enough, you should have known what I meant. But no, it just makes both of us sick! You were depressed not knowing what I was doing and I was upset that you didn't care about me. That was insane and childish of old Mint. 
    - Fix mistakes: apologize and do something to make things better. In the last 3-month of distance relationship, I made you cry for my emotional unstability. I made excuse that because I missed you so bad and that I worked a lot and that I felt unsafe being away from you. I apologized. And you were so patient and kind to help fix this together. I was so selfish that I forgot to think about your feelings. Eventually, I started to do better things. I practiced piano everyday, learned to draw, and learn to cook! That was a huge positive change in me! For now, the mistake becomes a fact and that fact cannot be fixed! But I can do something to make things better, right? I'm trying to be patient and kind just like the way you used to be to me. (Now you are not, sadly :(((( )
    - Learn and change to be better! Yes! That's what I'm doing and I'm very proud of myself for the good work. 
    - Laziness gets thing worse! Somehow laziness is a part of our breakup too. I was too lazy to invest on improving myself, just like to hanging out, watching films, surfing Instagram. How naughty I was!!!! But now, the new Mint is becoming much more hard-working than ever. She studies, she works, and she does volunteer, and she reads A LOT.
    - Keep your expectations low, manage your expectations. What we failed was that we didn't talk much about our expectations for the relationship. Haven't but will soon. 
    - Listen, listen, and listen. Yeah, we listen to each other, that's a very good thing to communicate. At least I have never had to shout out "Why don't you listen to me!". Did you ever feel that I didn't listen to you? 
    P/s: I feel very low and tired today. And I got heavy period stomache. I don't know if we can talk today. Don't worry, I ate dumplings and a lot of fresh fruits. I'm taking a glass of hot water now.
    Love you always and take care of yourself,
    Mint

    Let's get things better for todayyyyy! Did you work out? Did you brush your teeth? Did you clean up your room? Did you go Bèn bẹt? 
    I woke up at 8:30, worked out for 15mins, had breakfast, did some research on job seeking, and now reading at the same time with doing hulahoop! 
    I am reading the r/Ask you sent me: What quote stuck in your mind? 
    There is one quote that immediately makes me feel so eager to write you about and really want to share with you. "Now that I know better, I do better"
    The new Mint now no longer has dump, stupid, childish mindset as she was in high school. She now realizes the root of her repeated mistakes and she is trying to accept the fact and doing things that make it better. At least, she always tells herself not to get off track again. She adores you and you are her sunshine and her lighthouse. She is getting better for herself, for you, and for us.
    Love you always,

    How do you feel after our talk yesterday? Do you feel any better? Do you feel much relieved after telling your feelings without being afraid to hurt my feelings? Good work! You now learned how not to be afraid to hurt other's feelings. 
    First thing I realized is that I made you feel like my priority for you was in the bottom of the list. I apologized for that. In some moments, I admitted I had got others over you and even myself. I paid too much attention to what people think of me that I let them bully me and even thought that they would appreciate my sacrifice. I was wrong. But baby, I have never meant to put you in the bottom. I do care about how you feel and what you want, the point was I was too shallow and worry-free to patiently listen and observe you. Now I come to realize that my world is not completed without you. You are my other imperfection half that when matching together it becomes perfect. And I am happy that you now express what you think and feel so that I should pay more attention to that. I used to think that you were very happy hanging out with me, I was wrong. Now you are my first priority! The first thing I think about when I wake up is up, the last thing before bed is you, even when I eat, study, have a walk, all I think about is you. 😅 I think I'm obssessed with you, I need to control my thoughts about you!
    Second, I still very much disagree with you about sexy clothes. First, I feel confident and great wearing what I think is beautiful to me. Of course I won't dress like a slut with much 'revealing' like lingeries or something looking inappropriate. The confidence is from being comfortably wearing a beautiful set of clothes and looking through the windows with satisfaction that wow, look at that lovely chick in the mirror. I don't give a damn about how men or boys look at me, and the confidence I got is internally gained. Second, my clothes do not reflect what kind of person I am. This is a democratic community and that if I wear a 'revealing' top, I'm not entitled to a dirty bitch! And that my modesty is not a reflection of my commitment to you, my love! In fact, I feel very happy when dressing stunning, walking with you in the street, making you feel you deserve such a wise, great, beautiful woman. And I agree, only with you will I dress sexy. But in others, I still want to look stunning! 
    Third, I still think excessively about what I would do after 1 year, let say we want to be together but I'm not 100% percent ready for moving in with you again. And that history repeats itself as James said, I cannot guarantee that I will not be spoiled. At least for now, I haven't felt like I'm getting big enough. And I know asking you to wait for me is out of the question especially there are so many risks associating with it. I think to myself, if what I'm doing right now and what I have been doing couldn't make you feel safe and willingly to wait for me to get bigger. Then it's time to let you go... I cannot be such a selfish crap who tightens you and you have the right to free the bonds. Time will answer. Plus, if I really want to move in with you and move to another province together, it is quite impossible for me as (1) transferring credits will take time and not sure if all of the credits are accepted, and (2) I do not have scholarship and that I need to pay a high tuition fee as an international student. I don't mind moving to another province to be with you! But I'm a cheap asshole and I cannot afford my studying without such a scholarship... 😅😂
    Alright, will call you tonight! I will read and think about what freedom is to me and discuss with you.
    Love you always,

    After the talk with Micheal on free4talk, I couldn't help feeling so sad and lonely of myself when I talked about he used to cure his girlfriend from traumatic childhood. 
    I come to realize that my traumatic childhood causes me very many inappropriate thoughts in my adult relationship. It is like in my mind, it is automatically constantly seeking for a love to fill in the lack of family love. And when someone provides me with love and care, I easily get down. And yes, you are right about the fact that I might want a man who treats me like a dad that I always dream of. I never thought that my tramatic childhood will have anything to do with my adult life and I used to think that I have already got over that trauma. That trauma leads me to think differently in a relationship that my man should always love and care for me and I should be a baby girl who is filled with love and care. That is fucking selfish of me, sadly.
    What I did that I thought made me get over the trauma was to be brave and strong. I kept myself busy with study and work. I constantly tried to do my best for the future and bear in mind that what I do today will define my future, not the past. But I never stop and think about my past. I never really want to find way to heal myself from the past. I just leave it unresolved. Consequently, that unresolved trauma causes me a burden in my adult life, leads me to inappropriate standards, causes me pain and sufferings, and it is killing me if I cannot find a way to heal myself. 
    I'm sorry baby for not calling you today. I just cannot keep myself calm. And I'm trying to do research more about traumatic childhood. I hope I can find ways to heal myself first and by that, I can repair our relationship.
    Love you always,

    I'm on my way to Weng's bday party and in the mean time, I really want to write something for you. This is gonna be a very positive letter because I just realize how thoughtful you are from the very very little tiny daily life tasks and how relieved I am after seeing my dad in another aspect. It feels so good right now! 
    I read an article this morning about "15 ways to love someone." 
    1. Listen. Yes, I do listen to you, I don't jump in your throat. But what I haven't done is actively listening to you. Sometimes, when listening to you, though I don't do anything else, I don't really pay attention or put effort into understanding it. That is very inattentive of me. 
    2. Use my words. Hehehheee it means just tell you how I love you, how I appreciate you. To be honest, I use the words "I love you" excessively but barely use my heart to actually say it out loud. Recently, before saying ILY, I take a deep breath, think about how lovable you are and say it with all of my love! Does it make you feel being loved?
    3. Say thank you. It means that I need to understand how thoughtful you are to help me to really say thank you. And yes, I realize that I should thank you because you are so thoughtful that you know I hate cleaning the toilet, taking the trash, and cleaning the robot so you voluntarily do it for me. Before that, I used think it's your responsibilities, and mine is to cook tou breakfast everyday. How silly I am! 
    Well, to be continued! I'm in Weng's now! See you soon my love.
    Love you always,

    Let's continue "15 ways to love someone"
    4. Express interest. Asking "How is your day going?". I think we do it every day, especially in the weekends when I have to be away from home for work. I like sharing little moments in my daily life with you and listen to your daily stories. 
    5. Notice partner's need. I failed to ask what you need from me, from this relationship. I failed to pay attention to the very little change in your mind. Because you evolved, but I stayed unchanged as a baby.
    6. Do a favour for partner. Defenitely I want to help you out the most I can. That's why I asked to be your assistant because I saw you got stressed out at work. I want to bring you out for a walk to help you free your mind. I want to do you a spa in a hot tub and massage but you said the bath tub was too small and you liked to hug me sleeping better. Was it because my massage skills sucked??? Lol I will try my best next time, ok? Oh, I love that when I'm home seeing the tidy room, the finished laundry. I know it was my turn doing laundry and helping you out with cleaning room but you are so thoughtful to do me a lot of favors. Everytime you do me a favor, I will take a moment to appreciate it. 
    7. Physical affection. Yes, we all love it right? We like to be around and to stick with each other. But baby Mint was oversticking to Henry. She needs to give personal space for Henry :( What physical touches do you want, my love?
    Alright, I'm a little sleepy now. To be continued!

    I learn to value a moment before it becomes a memory. Everyday, I thank god for having chance to see you again, talk to you, and love you. You must be missing me so bad that you keep hugging the pillow. You must want to see me so bad that you start counting down days left. You must love and care for me so bad that you feel insecure when I'm not around you. Don't worry baby, I have learnt to take care of myself, to stand up for myself, to live without you physically. I always tell myself that you are here for me emotionally, you are accompanying me wherever I am, that makes me believe in myself and try my best again. Baby, I'm growing up to an adult, I'm not a baby anymore. I want to be your girlfriend, I want to care for you as a girlfriend caring for her boyfriend. Change the way you love me like a baby like this. You know I can always get over difficulty, right? And I know you can too! 
    Alright, let's continue with "15 ways to love someone"
    8. Quality time. I think we have quality time together, like a lot! We do exercise together, eat together, walk together, watch movies together, never let things interfere in our time together. Hmmmm! We sticked together! We need to spend more personal space for each other. I know it's hard since our no 1 token of love is physical touch huhu. But we can do it, it needs practicing more. 
    9. Give a gift. This is what I didn't do regularly. Giftgiving can express our love for each other too. You give so much that I used to take it for granted. Even for the little things as the rack for my skincare products or bringing me to go shopping to have new clothes for winter. Hehe you are my daddy, not my boyfriend! Always care for me like a baby. I gave you the heart-shape little tree but you didn't take it :( I wish I could be my token of love for you, I want to care for the tree as the way you care for me. As long as the tree is green, our love is green too.
    10. Handwritten notes. It is super romantic to me! Remember the first morning we were together in May? You slept so peacefully that I didn't want to wake you up for breakfast. I wrote down a note for you imagining that when you woke up, you would be filled with love from my loving notes and the breakfast right in front of you. Tell me what you felt about that. Did you feel loved when reading that? I forgot to ask you that. Can we spend a little time of our days writing a note for each other and sending each other please?
    11. Surprise. Not everyday but once in a while, "Surprises have the power to break your usual routine and create a memorable experience for your partner" Yes yes yes! I like surprises, do you? "[T]he key to being thoughtful is keeping your loved one's interests, desires, likes in mind as you make the care package." Let see what I can surprise you today. Can this email be a surprise? No :( you get used to receiving my email everyday so that when I miss a day you call me and ask for it right away!!!
    Okay, let's stop here! To be continued...

    content: `Hubby,
    Welcome back to my diary letter. Why did you wake up so early this morning? We should sleep early at night, hubby. My eyes look like a panda's now huhu. And STOP SCRATCHING YOUR PIMPLES. It is always annoying me every single time you touch your pimples. Alright, let's come back to "15 ways to love someone" 
    12. Be gentle during conflicting times. This is the most loving characteristic of you that incentivizes me to win your heart again. Even when you are in the most level of anger, you are still gentle to me. I really appreciate it because I know that you are kind enough not to hurt me. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't have disagreements. We should have to work things out. But let it be a discussion where two parties have equal voice. 
    13. Practice accountability. I know that I can count on you on every aspect. You are thoughtful and responsible enough to make sure I get the best of me. I truly believe in you, you are such a trustworthy hubby. I'm starting to take responsibilities for what I did and do. I'm foreseeing the results and consequences of my actions and decisions. It may be difficult at the first place, but I always bear in my mind that before making a decision, take a moment to meditate and deeply think. It helps.
    14. Give personal space. I used to think that being together means merging our life to fit in each other as much as possible. That's why I always sticked to you, wanted to know every trivial thing in your life. I was wrong. Even my own space for my own personal improvement, I wasted it. Now that we part with each other, I start valuing my personal space, and I know you are more comfortable having your own space. Although it is hard to completely lack in your physical presence, no one is here for me to ôm ôm thương thương, I will spend it till the time I see you again. 
    15. Ask how you want to be loved. I didn't think about the way you want me to love you. I just made assumption that I liked this way of loving you so I did it. You want me to cook you breakfast every day, to come to you all of a sudden to ôm ôm thương thương, to go jogging, hand in hand together, to hug each other sleeping, to eat together and share and talk trivial things. But that's all about physical love. What do you want me to love you emotionally? 
    Alright, call me tonight.
    Love you always,

    It has been almost 3 weeks since you left. It must be very difficult for you not to have someone who can be there for you to love and care for, to ôm ôm thương thương, to cook you breakfast, to hug you sleeping, to walk and hand in hand. I'm getting used to it. I no longer cry every single time thinking of you. I miss you too but I look forward to seeing you again and we can be together again. Looking forward and giving away love and care for you are what I can do now to stop negative thoughts in me. You should, too! I know you can do it.
    How do you feel about my apologies? Was it truthful enough for you to forgive me? Do you still have anything uncomfortable with? Please let me know how you feel and your problems. I do want you to share with me, I'm not sure I can help but at least I can try and understand. 
    And please do treat me equally as I'm your wife-to-be. Discuss the problems of two with me, please don't do every problem on your own. I know you want the best for me, you care for me, and don't want me to worry about it. But baby, I'm more than happy to be the one you trust and share with. I'm more than happy to get involved in problem-solving. I'm more than happy to see your worry going away. 
    Husband-To-Be, I want to be your lighthouse to chase away your worries!

    How do you feel after telling me what's in your mind? Does it feel better? Don't worry, you are just telling me the truth about the old Mint. I won't get too hurt about that. Instead, Mint is now strong enough to receive criticism and she will take it as feedback on improvement! If you feel better after telling me how you think of me, I'm more than happy to take it. I just want you to be relieved and have peace in your mind. 
    Thank you for all the sacrifices you have been making. You took the risk of giving your heart to me. You had been worried as hell about me. You called the ambulance for me. You flew to me even not sure if I would let you in. You cut your personal time being around with me. You took me to everywhere. You made me feel much secure in your shelter. You moved in with me and left behind all what you had. Even being depressed of homesick, you took care of me with the greatest care that you had. You never hurt me. You kept me warm and safe and happy. You gave me all you have and did all you could to be with me, to make me happy, and to be happy with me.
    Henry, thank you so much for all of it. I don't know what words to use to express my sincerity. And I know that you deserve much more than what I can give you now. I have been trying my best to be with you. And I am willing to move in with you and ready to take responsibilities. 
    But don't let these be a burden on you that you have to wait for me. Go and find someone else. Probably you can find someone deserved. What I want is you to be happy.

    After 2 masturbations, I still saw you unhappy. I'm sad too. I don't feel like having sex anymore. The sorrow, worry, and anger that I can read in your eyes make me heart-broken. If it keeps going like this, I don't know if I'm mentally strong enough to help you masturbate again. And it will forever exist in your mind, becomes a conditioned reaction, and never heals itself. 
    I feel insecure and much more hurt after masturbating, instead of telling me what you think, you choose to go online and find somebody else for you to share with. You don't want to share with me your feelings and I'm stuck with overthinking about how I can understand you, to help you get out of it. Gradually, I feel like we drift apart... I want to bring joy, love, and care back to your life. But why do I feel like seeing me makes you think of anger, sorrow, grief, and disgust? What should I do now?

    It's been a while since my last email for you. I want to write something for you today.
    Vancouver has been raining cats and dogs recently. I used to like hugging you watching the rain. I used to like hearing the sound of the rain. I used to think of the rain as something super romantic and chilling. I used to want to be in your warm, protecting arms and listen to you in rainy days. 
    But for now, I start to hate the rain. It makes me think of you more often. I try to get over it by work and piano. I keep myself as busy as I can be.  
    Nếu đang yêu nhau chỉ cần nhìn mưa sẽ nhớ nhau hơn?
    Thế nhưng sao chia tay lại sợ giọt mưa thấm đẫm cô đơn
    Cứ phải nghĩ hoài
    Giờ ai kia đang ở đâu và đang vui như thế nào?
    This song sounds like me right now. Check it out: 
    https://youtu.be/TfDHpsZQYeE
    I figure out why when I say "I love you", it sounds more touchy than before. Because now, I start to be in love with you, I choose to be in love with you, and my heart in is in love with you, too. As before, when I said "I love you", it was based on my feelings, my emotions. It might sound like I was saying it as a joke to you. 
    I like hearing you say "I love you". It always touches my heart, makes me goosebumped. Not until now do I realize that goosebump is because of your most sincere saying from your the bottom of your heart. And that when you say "I love you", you mean you want to be in love with me, to stay in love with me, and to be with me forever.
    I'm in love with you, husband-to-be.

    content: `Hi honey,
    Welcome back to my Diary. It's been a long long longgg time since I last wrote for you, isn't it? Here I come, honey.
    Today I feel much better that we have addressed my insecurities. For the first time you truly tell me what you think about my feelings, and about my being over controlling and unreasonable. I appreciate it that honey. You are doing great! Keep it up! Keep expressing yourself more. 
    Well, it is a me thing so I think the first thing I should do is to figure out why I feel insecure:
    1. I don't trust myself that I'm deserved to be loved. I'm in fear that others will get along with you more, understand you more, make you feel happier and trust. Well hell no, I'm such a lovely and loving girl that there should be no worry about that. Listen honey, I'm smart as hell, I'm competent and easy-learning. I'm strong and brave. I'm optimistic. And now I'm more thoughtful. See, omg look at this girl, she is a model everybody.
    2. I haven't truly trusted you as I said. If I trust you enough, I shouldn't have felt worried when you are talking with other girls. And that your clear boundaries won't let other chicks get in our relationship.
    3. You don't trust me. That's easy to understand, I know. But honey, I'm working on myself now. Feel much better day by day. Everytime a problem arises, I feel happy that I'm able to figure it out.
    Understanding the root of it is one thing. Knowing how to take step to fix it is another thing. 
    Will show you the steps in my next diary, okay? 
    Gotta work now, see you soon. Kiss you goodbye.
    Love you always,
    Your Wife-To-Be`,

    content: `Hey Honeyyyyy,
    I'm back and lợi hại than before. Were you waiting for my steps to get rid of insecurities. Well too bad, I'm not talking about this today.
    🤪😜😝😛😋
    Just kidding. Here we go! How to get rid of insecurities!
    1. Start with self-love. The core problem of insecurity is lack of self-love, as I told you yesterday. Lack of self-love leads to the fear of failure or thinking that I don't deserve to be loved. Seems like the remorseful old Mint still sticks to today lovely Mint. She deserves to be loved, and to love someone genuinely! Well ngl, but she really can live without love but she chooses to love you. And if you love her back, Honey, you can't keep torturing today loving Mint and make she feel bad of herself for her past Mint! You can do it! I can do it! We can do it! 
    2. Learn to communicate effectively. This lingering issue of me feeling insecure has been on and on repeatedly. That was because we failed to communicate. I was too stubborn, not willing to take criticism, and didn't trust myself enough. And you, you are too vague about expressing your thoughts, you have been yielding me so many times. Love comes from both sides, right? I can freely speak my mind, you too. Tell me your feelings, your needs, your requests, and how much you love and care for me! (Remember my love language? Words of Affirmation: 20%) And I know your love language is Act of Service, so I have been trying to be better, to help you become a better individual. I have been trying to help you optimize yourself, so please collaborate with me. Express yourself!
    3. Meet each other's needs. Yeah, it was me who is too needy and would constantly seek for attention to feel your love. My bad, honey, your love language is different from me so you show your love differently and I wasn't able to regconize it. Now I know! And I appreciate your time teaching me coding, your effort not to torture me, not to think badly of me, your precious chance to me, your hope for me. Instead, tell me your clear needs in me, that you want me to be loyal, to make commitment, to respect you, to be transparent and direct, to be willingly to fly to you, to be patient, and to keep my determination till we are ready to marry! Tell me that! That is your needs in me. You are just keeping your expectation low so you pretend not to desire that. And you are being afraid of me betraying you twice. God dammit! Believe it yourself, you silly, how come I dare to do that shit again. Gosh!
    4. Create new stories. Oh my love, this is what we need to do. Our story should start from zero. Holding on the past makes no sense. Sustainable relationship manages to leave mistakes in the past. If we decide to move forward as a couple, then it's time to let those old stories behind. 
    5. Stop overanalyzing. Yeah I know, all of my insecurities start from my head. My thoughts affect my emotions and all all other things! That is so bad. That is because I have been overthinking and overanalyzing. Omg stupid me. Keep it simple stupid!!! Well I have only one goal: be an admirable woman who is successful and independent, and has deep and meticulous thoughts. Well by that, I have many epics, and in my epic I have many small tasks too. Like get graduated with flying colors, get into an internship position, get a job before graduation and so on and on. And nurturing my inner soul to understand myself, to understand what it is to love someone, and to love you. You too Honey, stop overanalyzing about the possibilities. Why don't you look on the bright side!? Ask yourself and answer from your heart, "Do I want be with you?", "Do I want to trust you again when seeing your effort day by day", "Do I want to wait for you until we are all set to tie the knot?", "Do I want the best scene to come?" If yes, you gotta work on that. Stop imagining bad scenarios and lead to your insecurities. What do you think "Keep your expectation low" mean? It doesn't mean you have to keep thinking about bad scenarios, it doesn't mean you are not allowed to think about best scenarios. Thinking about worse scenarios helps you to have plan B, C, D,... not to make you feel insecure. Thinking about best scenarios gives you hope to hold on. 
    That is that! Let's research how to motivate you to express yourself in the next chapter. 
    Love you always,
    Your Wife-To-Be`,

    content: `Henry thương mến,
    Có 2 khả năng anh cho em 1 cơ hội để ta cùng ở bên nhau.
    1. Đó là anh còn yêu, còn thương em. Anh mong, anh hy vọng magic xảy đến và chúng ta sẽ ở bên nhau thêm một lần mữa. Và rằng tình yêu sẽ càng bền chặt hơn lúc đầu. Và đó là động lực để anh đi ngược lại đám đông, vượt qua mọi rào cản để cho em thêm một cơ hội nữa.
    2. Anh thương hại em. Nếu là như vậy, rõ ràng là có cố gắng extend thêm bao lâu nữa cũng chỉ càng làm nhau khổ đau thôi. I don't want your pity, I want your love. Em không cần sự thương hại. Em không cần sự khinh bỉ. Em không đến mức phải ăn xin lòng thương từ một ai khác. Và chắc chắn là anh cũng không muốn một mối quan hệ mà xuất phát từ sự thương hại, sâu thẳm là một sự khinh bỉ khi người đó không hoàn hảo về một mặt nào đó.
    Love and pity can be confusing
    
    Pity: I feel bad for you
    
    Love: I feel bad with you
    
    - Anh muốn giúp em trở nên tốt hơn vì anh muốn optimize relationship hay anh thấy em quá tệ?
    
    - Anh cảm thấy có trách nhiệm với em chứ? Và rằng nếu được lựa chọn, việc anh rời xa em có khiến anh dead inside?
    
    - Anh có thể move on, không suy nghĩ nhớ nhung gì về em không? Liệu rằng cuộc sống của anh sẽ ổn? 
    
    - Liệu rằng có phải vì anh nghĩ ra đi là sự lựa chọn tốt nhất cho cả hai đứa nên anh muốn đưa bản thân mình tới ý nghĩ là anh thương hại em?
    
    - Nếu anh còn yêu và thương em, anh có đủ kiên nhẫn và động lực để tiếp tục duy trì mối quan hệ này không?
    
    Em đã từng trong Long Distance Relationship. Em biết mình không thể duy trì được bởi vì tụi em còn quá nhỏ và không biết mong chờ níu kéo vào điều gì. Đó là một mối quan hệ mờ mịt, không tương lai. Em nghĩ là mình sẽ không bao giờ có LDR nữa cho đến khi em gặp anh. Tình yêu đối với em là emotional support. Em nghĩ về anh là em thấy vui, em có động lực để phấn đấu. Và bởi vì hai đứa mình communicate, listen, and share. Và em biết là mối quan hệ này sẽ thật thành công và mọi thứ sẽ workout nếu em VÀ anh cùng phấn đấu. I see my future with you. 
    Còn nếu như, chỉ một mình em phấn đấu, còn anh thì không share mục tiêu chung cùng em, vẫn luôn băn khoăn tự hỏi không rõ ràng trong việc đi nên ở lại. Nếu như rời xa em, anh có thể sống tốt, tâm hồn anh thanh thản. Thì anh nên đi. Em sẽ để anh đi. Bởi vì anh và em mỗi người một hướng rẽ rồi và rằng hai người sẽ grow apart thôi! 
    Em biết là trong anh phần muốn rời xa em lớn hơn, vì anh đã chuẩn bị kĩ càng scenario khi hai đứa breakup đến như thế rồi. Và một khi anh đã nghĩ đến viẹc breakup, có lẽ anh không đủ động lực để đi tiếp nữa. Làm gì có ai đang yêu mà lại nghĩ đến việc chia tay đâu hả anh? Haha
    Em biết anh muốn chờ em qua để anh được nhìn thấy em, để anh biết trong anh còn rung động khi gặp lại em không. Em nghĩ là có, chắc chắn. Chắc chắn là hai đứa sẽ có giây phút thật hạnh phúc, sẽ quấn vào nhau, sẽ cùng nhau sống lại giây phút hạnh phúc, sẽ tận hưởng hạnh phúc tuyệt đối. Rồi để đến khi rời xa, anh lại sẽ feeling low, lại sẽ hết động lực và chuyện này lại xảy ra tiếp, anh nghĩ đến breakup, còn em lại chạy lại để khiến anh feel secure.
    Điều gì đã khiến anh muốn bên em trong khi hai đứa đã từng trong LDR trước đây? Anh có cảm thấy emotional support từ em, nghĩ về em anh lại thấy vui, lại có động lực để duy trì không? 
    Một người giữ, một người buông. Một người níu, một người đi. Một người cố gắng, một người không. If it's the case, this relationship is not going to work out. 
    Yêu và thương anh,
    Mint 
    P/s: Không biết em có thể nói rằng mình là Wife-To-Be của anh được nữa không 🥺😜 Hahaaa anh đã rất muốn được ở bên em, đã muốn 2 đứa quay trở lại với nhau, đã mong chờ một tương lai, một mái nhà nhỏ của 2 đứa. Có lẽ bây giờ không còn nữa rồi sao? Em không muốn manipulate anh đâu. Nếu động lực của anh không xuất phát từ tình yêu chân thành, không có cùng mục tiêu chung với em thì làm sao mà em đủ sức mà kéo anh lên, motivate anh được đây? Rồi nó cứ diễn ra trong vòng luẩn quẩn mãi dzị á, đến lúc cả 2 đứa mệt rồi là tự buông á. `,

    content: `Thân gửi Henry (đã từng) của em,
    Chắc có lẽ giờ anh đi ngủ mất tiêu rồi, hoặc có lẽ là anh đang nằm trằn trọc cầm điện thoại lướt 9GAG, coi crypto, đọc báo,... 
    Em đã đọc 2 ls thư của anh rồi. Cảm ơn anh vì đã nói ra những điều anh mong muốn, cảm ơn anh đã muốn yêu em trở lại, cảm ơn anh đã biết tự mình thay đổi. Em cũng đã coi bài anh đàn. Chả hiểu sao mỗi lần em nghe bài này, em lại dạt dào cảm xúc và rơi nước mắt. Có lẽ là vì nó gắn liền với lần đầu tiên 2 đứa mình rời xa nhau. Khi đó anh đã cho em một bất ngờ rất lớn, "henryandmint.web.app". Em xúc động đến nỗi rơi nước mắt, vì hạnh phúc. Và video Vancouver Memory, anh cũng để background music là Can't Help Falling in Love. Ôi, chỉ cần nghĩ đến thôi là em lại thấy anh (đã từng) thật là ngọt ngào. 
    Khoảng thời gian qua em cũng đã cố gắng rất nhiều, em biết anh có cố gắng, cảm ơn anh vì điều đó. Em đã nghĩ là chỉ cần mình trao đi yêu thương thật nhiều, mình sẽ không cảm thấy hối tiếc và thất vọng vì bản thân đã phạm phải sai lầm lớn, tự mình đẩy anh đi. Mục tiêu ban đầu của em chỉ là muốn giúp anh vượt qua đợc betrayal trauma, đau thương do em mang đến, chính em là người hàn gắn vết thương cho anh. 
    Em rất vui vì giờ anh đã biết gượng dậy, anh đã mở lòng mình, anh đã biết move forward. Em vui vi anh đã tìm lại được chính anh, một Henry chân thật, soft-hearted, binh thản, nguyên tắc, và đam mê. Chúc anh sớm đạt được và làm được những điều trong bucket list của anh. 
    Hiện giờ em cảm thấy rất giận anh? Câu hỏi vẫn cứ quay quay trong đầu em. Mặc cho em đã ngôi thiền, thanh thản tâm trí một chút, nhưng nó lại ập về. Ban đâu em chỉ là muốn anh vượt qua giai đoạn đau thương này, để anh có thế lại một lần nữa yêu thương một ai đó như anh (đã từng) yêu em. Nhưng rồi em lại tham lam, nghĩ là mình và anh có thể quay lại, có thể xây dựng tương lai cùng nhau. Vì anh cho em hy vọng, và cũng có thể vì em ảo tưởng về nó. Tại sao, tại sao anh lại nói câu Anh Yêu Em khi mà chính anh còn không chắc là có phải anh yêu em không? Tại sao, tại sao anh lại quan tâm, chăm sóc cho em khi mà anh nghĩ đến việc rời bỏ em? Tại sao, tại sao anh lại nói đến tương lại, muốn có baby, muốn chờ có 100k rôi có baby? Tại sao, tại sao anh lại có thể masturbate cùng em khi mà anh không chắc là anh con yêu em không? Có phải là tại vì anh cảm thấy có lỗi hay cảm thấy thương hại em khi mà anh nhìn thấy em cố gắng từng ngày từng ngày một mà nên anh muốn cho em một chút hy vọng để em cố gắng tiếp? 
    Một câu hỏi lớn vẫn cứ loanh quanh trong đầu em. Tại sao chỉ vi một cái Yes từ một người lạ, mới có thể khiến anh có động lực muốn yêu em trở lại vậy? Em cảm thấy rất đau khổ khi mọi cố gắng mà em mang lại, mọi tinh yêu thương mà em trao đi cho anh lại không đủ thuyết phục anh bằng một câu Yes của người lạ.
    Đã có nhiều lần em thật khổ tâm, thật tổn thương, tổn thương đến mức không thể ngừng rơi nước mắt. Em ghét con người của em, có thể dễ dàng mít ươt đến như vậy. Em yếu đuối, đau khổ cũng chỉ biết khóc một mình. Vì anh nói mỗi lần nhìn thấy em khóc, kí ức xấu lại ùa về. Đến cả khóc thôi em cũng không được khóc nữa, đừng nói đến việc được người mình thương an ủi. Em cũng không dám buồn mặc dù em cảm thấy rất tồi tệ trước mặt anh vi em sợ anh sẽ không muốn ở bên một người lúc nào cũng chỉ buồn bã, mít ướt. Anh bị attracted bởi những cô gái vui vẻ hay mang lại tiếng cười. Em xin lỗi, em không thể trở thành con ngươi mà anh muốn được, em chỉ có thể trở thành người tốt hơn thôi. 
    Em càng đau khổ hơn nữa, khi anh đã dàn dựng được chi tiết plan khi mà anh sẽ nói chia tay em. 
    Còn đau khổ hơn nữa khi mà anh nghĩ đến việc tiếp tục extend.
    Em đã nghĩ là mình chịu tổn thương, đau khổ chút cũng không sao, vì mình đáng bị như thế. Nhưng có lẽ là em sai rồi. Có phải em đang manipulate anh không? Làm anh không thể decisive? Nhiều lúc em cảm thấy mình thật low self-esteem. Cho đi hết cả tấm lòng, sẵn sàng chờ đợi anh, tình nguyện để anh quyết định mối quan hệ này. Con tim em trao anh, tâm trí em cũng là anh, đến cả tình yêu này cũng là anh làm chủ. 
    Khi anh nói anh không biết có phải anh còn thương yêu em không, hay là anh thương hại em, và lại nói cho em biết đến viễn cảnh chia tay. Em đã đau, đau thật nhiều. Nhưng em cũng đã chuẩn bị tâm lý sẵn sàng đón nhận quyết định từ anh rồi... 
    Đáng lẽ ra khi ở trong một low expectation như vậy, khi mà anh nói anh muốn yêu em trở lại, đáng lẽ ra em phải vui mưng mới đúng chứ, em phải hạnh phúc đến điên dại chứ. Tại sao em lại cảm thấy trống rỗng như này? Có phải là em đang reasoning quá nhiều không? Em không biết. Em không depressed, không cảm thấy overwhelmed, cũng không cảm thấy hoang mang. Em chỉ là trống rỗng không thể nghĩ được là sẽ dừng lại hay đi tiếp.
    P/s; Em không tin vào cái gội là meant to belong together. Làm gì có chuyện take break 6m-1y lại có thể quay trở lại yêu được nhau nữa cơ chứ. Không có tình yêu nào là không tốn công sức và cố gắng để dựng xây được. Remember? Even happy relationships need effort, even more. I don't believe in destiny. 6m break không liên lạc, không tiếp xúc, cảm xúc sẽ dần nhạt phai thôi. Chính anh nói, chính anh cảm thấy anh đang dần xa lánh em mặc dù ngày nào em và anh cũng video call cùng nhau, mặc cho em có thể hiện tình yêu thương của mình nhiều đến thế nào. 
    Thân và thương,

    Lâu lắm rồi em không có viết thư cho anh. Hôm nay em viết rùi nè, bất ngờ chưa? Hehe. Hôm nay em bắt tay vô làm Love Bank, chả biết thế nào lại mò vô Loveisnotenough, thế là lại coi gallery. 
    Em thèm được nấu bữa sáng cho anh, sung sướng mang bữa sáng lên lầu gọi anh dậy ăn. Những hôm anh mệt, em sẽ mang thêm một cốc chanh mật ong ấm lên cho anh uống từng ngụm. Thèm những lúc sáng dậy sớm làm bánh cuốn, loay hoay cả 2,3 tiếng đồng hồ, bắt anh nhịn đói chờ em làm bánh cuốn xong. Thế là ăn xong một núi bát đĩa chờ anh dọn haha.
    Em thèm được hửi hửi, hít hà mùi hui nách của anh. Thỉnh thoảng anh đang ngồi làm việc, em sẽ chạy lại cạp cạp cho anh một miếng, chụt chụt cho anh vài miếng, đòi ôm ôm thương thương một chút rùi lại quay về bàn học tiếp.
    Em thèm được workout cùng anh, ngồi coi anh chật vật pushup, leg raises, plank mà em cười muốn chít. Haha có một con voi đang tập thể dục trong phòng. Con voi mập địt chật vật chật vật với chiếc bụng mỡ núng nính núng nính.
    Em thèm được ngắm anh cắm cúi trong bếp nấu bữa cơm cho em, rồi ra trước cửa nhà đón em đi làm về. Mỗi lần đi làm về dòm thấy anh dang rộng đôi tay là chỉ muốn sà vô lòng anh để anh thương thương thui. Thế là một ngày làm việc mệt nhọc, ấm ức lại được xoa dịu. Ngồi ăn cơm cùng anh, bà tám cùng anh, vừa ăn vừa chọc nhau cười đùa.
    Em thèm được ăn xong đi dạo quanh phố, em sẽ lại hỏi những câu hỏi ngu ngốc, anh cứ như giáo sư biết tuốt, trả lời hết những thắc mắc trong em. Rùi anh lại cong đít chạy bắt em phải chạy theo mệt đứt hơi.
    Em thèm được về nhà ngồi học đàn, anh đứng bên cạnh nagging rùi lại cười ha hả mỗi khi em uýnh đàn sai nhịp. Rồi lại coi anh uýnh đàn một cách đam mê. Tay anh thì nhẹ nhang múa lượn trên phím đàn, eo ôi!!!! Anh có bít là anh rất đáng iu khi ngồi nghiêm túc uýnh đàn hông? Mỗi lần như thế, em chỉ muốn yên lặng ngồi bên nghe anh đàn thui.
    Em thèm được tối ôm anh cuddle rui coi phim. Mỗi lần có oánh nhau là em ẽ rúc vô ngực anh vì sợ, rùi em lại ngủ gật hổng coi hết phim. Anh nhẹ nhàng đắp chăn cho em, ôm lấy em, chỉnh lại gối cho em ngủ thiệt ngon. 
    Em thèm được mở mắt ra buổi sáng, người đâu tiên em thấy là anh!

    Vậy là, đã 2 cái giao thừa bên nhau rồi. 
    What should I write for you now? I don't know, I have no preparation, so what I write below might be a little bit unorganized. I just want to follow my heart. Hope that you can feel me.
    I was very much surprised and touched by your 100% effort for making a lovely gift for me for the 2022 in Stardew. I don't know why I burst into tears when I see it. Maybe because I'm soft-hearted or sensitive? Or because I truly understand your effort in building it for me - for your loved one? What I could see is that because you truly, genuinely, completely love me, you care to show me your love by putting all you have, whatever it takes, your precious time in Stardew to surprise me. Honey, you surely take me by surprise. Ummm... thank you, you are the love of my life. 
    As I promised, I, Mint Nguyen, aka your loving fiancé ,hereby issue the very first wish ticket in 2022 for you, Henry, aka the best man to me. Use it wisely! As soon as you see this diary, contact your girlfriend to claim your ticket.

There could be times when we feel so lonely and vulnerable, that's totally fine. I just wanna let you know that I am always here for you. So honey, don't just keep it to yourself, OK? You can be vulnerable too and you are free to come to me being a little boy. 
    Uhmmm, I know you have been working very hard recently for our future. Me too, everytime when I feel missing you, I keep myself busy by studying and working. I work so that I would not miss you anymore. I work also because I want to keep up with you.  I don't want to be a burden on you and I don't want you to take the sole burden. I want to work for our future also. :)
